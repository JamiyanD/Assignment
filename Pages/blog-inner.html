                <h1>Breaking the code How did we build our Figma plugin</h1>
                <p1>Writing UX copies can be a little frustrating and confusing, and sometimes we are unsure about how
                    to get
                    the right word. To crack the code for the UX copies, we at Zeta Design wanted to build a Figma
                    plugin
                    for the larger design community. The plugin is called the Ghost UXWriter and has a set of UX copies
                    cataloged and categorized with a voice and tone variation ranging from plain, casual to playful. The
                    intention to build this Figma plugin originated from our Medium blog post, ‘Designing voice and tone
                    for
                    error messages.</p1>
